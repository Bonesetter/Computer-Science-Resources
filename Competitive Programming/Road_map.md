**CP Roadmap**
Once you have learned a programming language and have decided to start with CP, the next question is what to study and from where. It can often be confusing as to what to do since CP is predominantly based on exploration and experience. Here I list some of the topics that you can start with (in the order listed)


 - First learn basic greedy and binary search. These can be done from leetcode or GFG
 - Then solve as many Div 2 A level questions in codeforces as possible (atleast 50). This can done from the problemset or A2OJ ladder. You will build up speed as you keep practicing
 - Once you have started getting A level questions on your own fairly frequently and quickly, you can now move on to B level questions.
 - B level questions often require a variety of topics. These need to be covered - 
   - Prefix and suffix sums
   - use of STL (in C++)
   - GCD and LCM and their theorems (Euclids theorem)
   - Prime numbers and their properties (Sieve)
   - Modular arithmetic and modular inverse (Extended Euclid)
   - Bit manipulation and XOR (very important)
   - MEX (minimum excluded)
   - Basic Game theory
 - Be sure to solve atleast some questions pertaining to each of these topics (around 150-200 in total would be good) . It will take a while before you get comortable with B level questions. Remember, never stop giving contests - Improvement comes from contests
 - After this you can move on to C level questions. By this point you would hopefully have reached pupil level in codeforces. The difference in difficulty between B and C is usually quite large, so dont get you hopes down if you do not see improvement even after several months. The topics you need to cover are 
   - DP, to a good level. Atcoder beginner DP contest is a very good starting point
   - Binary Search over answer
   - Constructive questions (there is no real way to get good at this other than practicing a lot of questions)
   - Basic Tree and Tree DP
   - Basic Graph (BFS, DFS, Dijikastra)
   - Adhoc questions (again, practice is the only way)
 - Once you regularly start getting C level questions, you can read Expert rated on codeforces. This is the point from which coding rounds start to feel easy and natural to you. But there is lot more to go. Now we proceed to D level questions. This brings about a wave of new topics you need to gain mastery in 
   - Graph to a good level (cycles, DFS tree, Bellman Ford, Floyd Warshall etc)
   - Game theory to a good level
   - DP with optimization (eg prefix optimization)
   - LCA
   - DSU
   - Segment Tree (with lazy propagation)
   - Fenwick Tree
   - Sparse Table
   - Square Root Decomposition and Mo's algorithm
   - String algorithms (KMP, prefix array, Z array, Rabin Karp, Trie)
